# Optical Mark Recognition OPENCV

• Developed a Python algorithm using OpenCV for automatic grading of bubble sheets, improving accuracy and efficiency in grading.
• Implemented Gaussian blur, edge detection, and Hough Circle Transform for reliable bubble detection and sheet alignment.
• Achieved a high detection accuracy of 98%, validating the effectiveness of the algorithm in automated assessment and scoring
